So today I mainly worked on laying down what will be the basis of this language, this required me to dive so far deep in how languages are structured, classified, & identified. I also had to learn about the different types of nationally agreed sounds by the IPA (i’m gonna try and make specific notes about each sound and link them to wherever they’re mentioned). 

Languages are so much harder than they seem, like wow, so many different components and I haven’t even scratched the surface. For my conlang (constructed language), I’m taking some light inspiration from Chinese & Japanese especially in their morphology (how words are built). I went for a mix between Isolating (One word = one meaning. No affixes.) and Agglutinative (affixes to show grammar), not really much rhyme or reason behind it, just thought it’d be interesting.
