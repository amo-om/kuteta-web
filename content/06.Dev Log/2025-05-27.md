Okay so this is before i’m changing any files, but I think the symbols I’ve made so far would be good for a syllabry/abugida due to their structure but would kinda be impractical for an alphabet, so i’m gonna work on designing an actual alphabet

Not much I did today, just messed around with the website to change how it looks, and fixed some incosistencies, I’ll be taking some feedback from friends to improve its visual appeal
