Okay today the main goal is to develop a new & improved alphabet, which can be combined at the writers discretion to form words & sentences whether side to side, stacked up & down, or in a circle.

I think Korean Hangul script will be my main inspiration for this because it really fits with the circles & lines theme i’m going, so I may scrap my existing glyphs for a future conlang based on Logographs (like Chinese characters).

Okay so I finished my script and I really like how its looking, here’s the main rundown (read the main note for all the details):
![[script#^a7b879]]Hangul really saved me, especially with the flexibility I was able to make, whether you write in a block, english-like, or in a circle (will be a feature, trust), the script is pretty readable once you get it. This is very different on what I said on the 26th:
>[!quote] so by the end we’ll have: Glyphs representing the alphabet, Glyphs representing syllables, & a script for the alphabet. I think the syllabic glyphs will just be simplified combinations of the existing ones so far. 

I just made glyphs that act as both an alphabet & syllable. 
I also decided to make some [[romanisation]] conventions, to make it a bit easier when I’m writing words in Kuteta [^1], overall pretty good progress. I am also using a new theme for the website based on the “Fancy A Story” theme on obsidian, hopefully I can figure out all the css.

[^1]: I might eventually develop a different way of romanisation instead of standard english, I’ll modify letters to look like their original glyphs, we shall see…
